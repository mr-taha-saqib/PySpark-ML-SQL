# Movie and Wine Dataset Analysis Using PySpark

This project involves analyzing the `Movies.csv` dataset using PySpark DataFrames and performing clustering and analysis on the Wine dataset. The tasks include data exploration, querying specific details from the movie dataset, preprocessing the Wine dataset, and implementing clustering algorithms.

## Project Tasks

### **Movie Dataset (Movies.csv)**  
Explore the dataset and perform the following tasks using PySpark DataFrames:

1. **Action Films Winning Awards**  
   Find the title, year, and director of action films that won an award.

2. **Award-Winning Actors' Movies**  
   For each award-winning actor, find the movies they acted in. Print the names of the movies along with the director of each movie.

3. **Top 10 Most Popular Non-Award-Winning Movies**  
   Identify the top 10 most popular movies that did not win an award.

4. **10 Least Popular Pre-1980 Movies**  
   Find the 10 least popular movies that were released before 1980.

5. **Sorting Movies Released Before 1990**  
   Sort the list of movies released before 1990 by their titles.

### **Wine Dataset**
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**  
   - Explore the Wine dataset (provided in the previous lab) using PySpark DataFrames.
   - Perform data preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Identify outliers or noise in the data.
   - Analyze the correlation between different features in the dataset.

2. **Clustering Analysis**  
   - Use PySpark built-in **K-Means** and **Bisecting K-Means** clustering algorithms to cluster the Wine dataset.
